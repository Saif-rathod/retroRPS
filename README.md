# 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors: Retro Hacker Edition

A fun and visually stunning Rock-Paper-Scissors game with **arcade neon** and **hacker matrix** themes.  
Challenge the AI in a stylish duel with retro sounds and animations!

Think you can outsmart the machine? 🤖
🔥 Choose your move:

🪨 Rock → But the AI already knows…

📄 Paper → The AI saw that coming…

✂️ Scissors → The AI anticipated that too…

🛡️ No matter what you play, the AI is always one step ahead.
💀 Victory is an illusion.
Can you break the game or will you be stuck in an endless losing loop?

🎯 Prove your hacking skills or surrender to the machine!

🛠️ Bonus Tip
If you want to make the game "winnable" but extremely difficult, you could:

Add a rare win condition (like a 1% chance of the AI messing up).

Display taunting messages when you lose, like:

"Nice try, human. Try again."

"You thought you had me? 😂"

Add an Easter egg that lets you cheat (e.g., secret key combo).
